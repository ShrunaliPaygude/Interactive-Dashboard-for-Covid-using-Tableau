This is an interactive dashboard for COVID-19 cases using Tableau

COVID-19 is caused by a coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness. 

This interactive dashboard shows where and when the virus started and how the cases started to spread across the world.
